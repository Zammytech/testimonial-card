                step by step. I was encourage to enroll by a former student of thiers who can only say wonderfull things about the program.
                The entire curriculum and staff did not dissapoint. They were very hands-on and i never had t wait long for assistance. The agile 
                team project,in particular was outstanding. It look my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. 
                in fact, i've often refered to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job
                as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers.100% recomended!"
